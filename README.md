# House_prices_regression

It is a Advanced Problem of Regression which requires advanced techniques of feature engineering, 
feature selection and extraction, modelling, model evaluation, and Statistics.

In this project, we are going to predict the price of a house using its 80 features.

# Goal:
to predict the Saleprice prices for each house.

# Data exploration.
1.training data set has 1460 samples, 80 features,1 target variable.
2.test data has 1459 samples, 80 features.
3.the target variable is SalePrice.

# Feature engineering.
1.the test dataset set and train dataset has same columns with uneven categories, therefore Concatenate both the datasets.
2.Checking for missing values.
